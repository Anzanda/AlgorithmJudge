-problem
N integers are given. At this time, write a program to find the minimum and maximum values.

-Input
The first line is given the number of integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000). The second line is given N integers separated by spaces. All integers are integers greater than or equal to -1,000,000 and less than or equal to 1,000,000.

-Output
The minimum and maximum values of N integers given in the first line are separated by spaces
